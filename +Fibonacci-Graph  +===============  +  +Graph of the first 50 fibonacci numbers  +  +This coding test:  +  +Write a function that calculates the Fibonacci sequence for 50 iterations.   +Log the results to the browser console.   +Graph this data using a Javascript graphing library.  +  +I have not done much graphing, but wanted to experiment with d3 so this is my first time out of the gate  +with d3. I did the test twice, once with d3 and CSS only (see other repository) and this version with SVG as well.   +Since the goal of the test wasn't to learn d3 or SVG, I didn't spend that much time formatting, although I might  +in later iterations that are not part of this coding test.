+Fibonacci-Graph
 +===============
 +
 +Graph of the first 50 fibonacci numbers
 +
 +This coding test:
 +
 +Write a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence for 50 iterations. 
 +Log the results to the browser console. 
 +Graph this data using a Javascript graphing library.
 +
 +I have not done much graphing, but wanted to experiment with d3 so this is my first time out of the gate
 +with d3. I did the test twice, this one uses only d3 and css with no SVG.
